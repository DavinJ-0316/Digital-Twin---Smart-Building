# Digital-Twin---Smart-Building
Digital Twin - Smart Building: Based on the initial version, add a time bar. When you move the time bar, the status of each room will be reflected such as temperature, light, and people in room.

- Office rooms: The v110 and v111 are equipped with light sensors, and the v159 and v154 are equipped with temperature sensors and PIR sensors (person in the room)

- Common rooms: The v116, v131, and entrance are equipped with temperature sensors and PIR sensors (person in the room)

- Changing color to red means warm, Changing color to red means blue means cold

- Changing color to white means bright, Changing color to grey means blue means dark

- Small green ball means there is someone in the room at that moment
